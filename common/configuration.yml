## Mutations information can be provided in 3 options: 
## 1. Required Mutations mentioned in input file (in a column called "amino acid mutation") would override this 
## 2. Required Substitutions provided as a file
## 3. Carry out Mimetic substitutions (base on genome wide substitution maps). Only for human and yeast.
## input: options 
## mutations: 1, substitutions: 2, mimetic: 3, [no input: keeps all possible mutations (slow)]
